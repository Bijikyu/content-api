The `index.js` file is part of a Node.js application that uses the Express framework to define a router for handling file upload-related routes. It includes middleware for parsing JSON request bodies and defines routes for uploading trailers, videos, and thumbnails. Each route uses a corresponding function from an external module, `uploadHelper.js`, to interact with an S3-compatible storage service to list object keys within specified bucket prefixes.

The `uploadHelper.js` file sets up a Minio client to interact with an S3-compatible storage service. It configures the client using settings from a configuration file and provides two functions: `getTrailerObjectKeys` and `getVideoObjectKeys`. These functions list object keys from the S3 bucket, filtering by a prefix for trailers and without a prefix for videos, respectively. The file also allows for insecure TLS connections by disabling TLS/SSL certificate validation.

Both files work together to provide an API for listing and managing file uploads to an S3-compatible storage service. The `index.js` file handles the HTTP request and response cycle, while `uploadHelper.js` performs the actual interaction with the storage service. The setup suggests that the application could be part of a larger system, such as a video content management platform, where users can upload and manage their media files.
