The provided JavaScript files are part of a Node.js application that interacts with S3-compatible storage services and sets up HTTP routes for a web application.

### cnHelper.js
This module, `cnHelper.js`, is a helper utility that provides functions to interact with S3-compatible storage buckets using the Minio client. It includes dependencies for HTTP requests, file system operations, and FTP operations. The module disables TLS/SSL certificate validation for insecure connections and sets up a Minio client using configuration from a JSON file. There are three main functions:

1. `getTrailerObjectKeys`: Lists object keys with a 'trailers/' prefix from a specified bucket.
2. `getVideoObjectKeys`: Lists all object keys from a specified bucket, defaulting to 'xxxmultimedia-downloads'.
3. `getVodObjectKeys`: Lists all object keys from a 'vods' bucket.

Each function initializes a data object, sets a default bucket name, and creates a stream to list objects from the Minio client. They handle 'data', 'error', and 'end' events to populate the data object with object keys, log information, and invoke a callback with the results. The functions are exported for use in other modules.

### index.js
The `index.js` file sets up an Express router for the 'clipnuke' application. It includes middleware for parsing cookies, bearer tokens, and JSON request bodies. The router defines several routes:

- A test route that returns a JSON message.
- Routes for fetching trailers, videos, and VODs (Video on Demand) using the helper functions from `cnHelper.js`.
- A route for fetching bucket information (though the actual function `getBuckets` is not defined in the provided `cnHelper.js` code).
- A test route to check token retrieval from the request.

The router also mounts an upload router for handling file uploads. The `clipnuke` router is exported for use in other parts of the application.

In summary, these files work together to provide a web server with routes for listing and retrieving information about objects stored in S3-compatible buckets, as well as handling file uploads. The `cnHelper.js` module encapsulates the logic for interacting with the storage service, while `index.js` defines the HTTP interface for the application's web services.
