The provided files are part of a Node.js application that integrates with a WooCommerce store via its REST API. Here's a summary of each file's purpose and functionality:

### `client.js`
This file initializes a WooCommerce API client using the `woocommerce-api` npm package. It configures the client with the WordPress site's base URL and the necessary API credentials (consumer key and secret), which are retrieved from environment variables. The client is set to use the WooCommerce REST API and is exported for use elsewhere in the application.

### `index.js`
This module uses Express.js to set up routing for handling WooCommerce-related HTTP requests. It includes a router with routes for getting a welcome message, posting a new product, and retrieving a product by its ID. The routes utilize a helper module (`wooHelper.js`) to interact with the WooCommerce API. The `body-parser` middleware is used to parse incoming JSON request bodies. The router is exported for integration into the larger Express application.

### `wooHelper.js`
This helper file contains functions for posting new products and retrieving products by ID from the WooCommerce store. It uses the `@woocommerce/woocommerce-rest-api` package to interact with the WooCommerce REST API. The file reads configuration settings from a JSON file located at a path specified by an environment variable. The `postProduct` function sets up a new product with specific attributes and variations, such as file format options, and handles the creation of product variations. The `getProduct` function retrieves a product's details by its ID. Both functions use promises to handle asynchronous API requests and responses, and they are exported for use by other modules.

In summary, these files work together to provide an interface between a Node.js application and a WooCommerce store, allowing the application to create and retrieve products programmatically through the WooCommerce REST API.
