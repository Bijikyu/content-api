The provided descriptions pertain to two JavaScript files that are part of a Node.js application, which integrates with the Azure translation service.

**File: azureHelper.js**
This file contains a module that defines a `translate` function. The function is designed to interact with the Azure Cognitive Translation Service API. It requires an API key and a callback function to process the response. The function logs the event data, constructs an HTTP POST request with necessary headers (including a unique client trace ID), and the body containing the text to be translated. It then sends the request to the Azure translation service and handles the response or error by invoking the provided callback function. The module exports the `translate` function so it can be used by other parts of the application.

**File: index.js**
This file sets up an Express router specifically for Azure-related routes and includes middleware for configuration loading and JSON body parsing. It imports the `azureHelper.js` module for Azure operations. The router defines a test route to confirm its functionality and a translation route that handles POST requests for text translation. The translation route extracts the request body, logs it, and uses the `translate` function from the `azureHelper` module to process the translation. It handles the response by either logging the translation data and sending it back to the client as JSON or sending a 500 error response if an error occurs. The router is then exported for use in other parts of the application.

Synergistically, these files work together to provide a backend service that can receive translation requests via an Express API endpoint, process these requests using Azure's translation service, and return the translated text to the client. The `azureHelper.js` module encapsulates the interaction with the Azure API, while `index.js` manages the routing and request handling, leveraging the helper module to perform the actual translation task.
