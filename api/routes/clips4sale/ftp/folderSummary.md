The `ftpHelper.js` file is a Node.js module that provides functionality for uploading files to an FTP server. It supports uploading various file types, including general files, trailers, videos, and posters. The module can handle files from HTTP sources or S3-compatible storage services. It uses external modules such as `hyperquest` for HTTP requests, `fs` for file system operations, `path` for file path operations, `ftp` for FTP operations, and `minio` for interacting with S3-compatible storage.

The module defines an `upload` function that connects to an FTP server using credentials, determines the appropriate destination path based on file type and event type, and uploads the file. It checks if the file already exists on the server before uploading and handles different event types like trailers, videos, and posters. The module also includes error handling and logs various actions and errors to the console. There is a duplicate `httpUpload` function that appears to be intended for HTTP uploads, but it is largely similar to the `upload` function. The module exports both `upload` and `httpUpload` functions.

The `index.js` file is a Node.js module that sets up an FTP route for an Express application. It uses the `body-parser` module to parse JSON request bodies and reads configuration from a JSON file located in the `APPDATA` directory. The module defines a POST route that receives upload requests, logs the event, and uses the `ftpHelper` module to handle the actual upload process. It responds to the client with the result of the upload operation. The `ftp` Router created in this module is exported for use in other parts of the application.

In summary, these files work together to provide an FTP upload service within an Express application. The `ftpHelper.js` handles the core functionality of connecting to an FTP server and uploading files, while `index.js` sets up the web server routing, request parsing, and integration with the `ftpHelper` module.
